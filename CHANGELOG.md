# Changelog

## [0.0.1] - 2026-10-25

### Added

- Initial experimental graph-GRU language model with hierarchical routing and optional learned delta-rule memory.
- Byte-level English training, full-document streams, assistant-target masking, checkpoint/resume and generation/evaluation commands.
- Independent QA and English replay sampler controls with legacy-compatible defaults and explicit seed provenance.
- Controlled acquisition, retention, adaptation-seed and schedule-component experiments, with 75 regression tests passing before this release cleanup.
- Organized documentation, compact experiment evidence and original-document provenance archives under `docs/`.

### Changed

- Set package and lockfile version to 0.0.1.
- Replaced the long root README with a concise setup, architecture, evidence and documentation overview.
- Moved important Markdown documentation to `docs/`; removed obsolete working-plan Markdown files after preserving their original text and hashes.
- Excluded generated datasets, checkpoints, caches, build outputs and full local artifacts from publication.

### Research limitations

- Tiny-task memorization depends on replay sampling; reliable held-out binding and chat are not established.
- Dynamic node growth, rewiring, sparse execution, broad device support and Transformer superiority are not demonstrated.
